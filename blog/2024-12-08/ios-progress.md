# A Note About iOS Development and Open Source

## With a beta Android client out where is the ios version?

I wanted to take a moment to address questions about an iOS version of the Pinepods client. I have gotten them plenty of times before. The short answer is: yes, it's coming, but there are some hurdles we need to navigate first.

As an open-source developer, I've poured countless hours into making Pinepods the best it can be. The Android app is now live (in beta with some known issues), but when it comes to iOS, Apple presents a challenge for open-source projects. Unlike Android, which allows developers to freely distribute apps they've built, Apple requires a $99/year developer account just to compile and distribute iOS apps.

This creates an interesting dilemma. While I'm happy to donate my time and expertise to build and maintain Pinepods, the Apple developer fee represents a recurring financial commitment. As primarily an Android user myself, it makes sense to focus first on perfecting the Android experience before taking on this additional cost.

My current goal is to establish a sustainable way to cover the Apple developer fee through community support. This isn't about profit – it's simply about ensuring I can maintain consistent iOS availability without it becoming a personal financial burden. I believe that once we have about $100 in annual donations, we can confidently move forward with iOS development knowing I can sustain it long-term.

This doesn't mean an iOS version isn't happening – quite the opposite. The groundwork is already laid in the codebase because the client is built with Tauri. If I paid the $99 I could go compile to ios tomorrow. But I want to be transparent about here. In the meantime, I'm focusing on making the Android app as polished as possible, which will ultimately benefit the iOS version directly because it's the same codebase.

If you're interested in helping make the iOS version a reality sooner, consider supporting the project either via [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/collinscoffee) or [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/madeofpendletonwool). I will eventually pay this regardless. I just don't want to until the app is the best it can be. And regardless of platform, thank you for being part of the Pinepods community.

Stay tuned for updates, and happy podcasting!
