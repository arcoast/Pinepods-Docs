# API Documentation

Looking for hot tips on how the PinePods API works? You came to the right place. I tried to build the PinePods API with as much functionality as one might need to build a client for podcast management as you would need. The API system is built on fast API and any call requires the API token be passed along with the request and potentially data needed to make the call.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
