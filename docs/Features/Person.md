# People

Pinepods supports the Person tag as defined by the PodcastIndex Namespace in addition to the PodPeopleDB. Any podcast that either includes the Person tag or is associated with a host in the PodPeopleDB will show hosts on the main podcast page in a dropdown:

![People Podcast;](../../static/img/people.png)

In addition, you'll find individual episodes show guests as part of the people shown on the episode view:

![Guest Podcast;](../../static/img/peopleepisode.png)

The PodPeople DB is used in addition to the Person tag to suppliment podcasts that don't yet support the tag. PodPeopleDB is a community contribution and any podcasts that don't have hosts associated with them or a person tag will give an option to add hosts manually. Which looks like this:

If you do see a podcast that looks like this and are willing to help out please click the link and add information on the hosts that are part of your favorite podcasts! This will allow you to subscribe to feeds from your favorite hosts and will allow anyone else in the future to get the host data as well!
