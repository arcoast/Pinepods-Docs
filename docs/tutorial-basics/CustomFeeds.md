# Custom Feed Addition

The Custom Feed feature in Pinepods allows users to manually add podcast feeds that may not be available in standard podcast directories like The Podcast Index or iTunes. This is particularly useful for premium podcasts, private feeds, or independent creators who aren't indexed by major discovery services.

## Overview

Custom feeds enable you to subscribe to any podcast with a valid RSS feed URL, regardless of whether it's publicly indexed. This feature supports both public feeds and premium/protected feeds that require authentication credentials.

## Accessing Custom Feed Addition

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the main menu
2. Expand the **Custom Feed** or **Add Feed** section
3. All users can add custom feeds to their personal podcast library

## How to Add Custom Feeds

### Basic Feed Addition

For publicly accessible podcast feeds:

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. Locate the **Add Feed** section in settings
2. Enter the podcast's RSS feed URL in the **Feed URL** field
   - Example: `https://bestpodcast.com/feed.xml`
3. Leave Username and Password fields empty for public feeds
4. Click **Add Feed** to subscribe to the podcast
5. Wait for confirmation that the podcast was successfully added

### Premium Feed Addition

For password-protected or premium podcast feeds:

#### Required Information
