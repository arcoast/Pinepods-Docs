# Using Clients in Pinepods

There's client versions of Pinepo for Linux (Deb and Appimage, Flatpak is on the way), Mac, and Windows. Scroll down for install instructions. 

### Linux Client Install :computer:

Any of the client additions are super easy to get going. First head over to the releases page on Github

Grab the latest linux release. There's both an app image and a deb. Use the appimage of course if you aren't using a debian based distro. Change the permissions if using the appimage version to allow it to run.

```
sudo chmod +x pinepods.appimage
```

^ The name will vary slightly based on the name so be sure you change it or it won't work.

There's a exe and msi windows install file. 

The exe will actually start an install window and allow you to properly install the program to your computer. 

The msi will simply run a portable version of the app.

Either one does the same thing ultimately and will work just fine.

There's a dmg and pinepods_mac file. 

Simply extract, and then go into Contents/MacOS. From there you can run the app.

The dmg file will prompt you to install the Pinepods client into your applications fileter while the _mac file will just run a portable version of the app.
