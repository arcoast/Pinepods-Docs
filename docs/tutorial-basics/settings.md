## Admin vs. User Settings

Pinepods distinguishes between administrative settings (server-wide configuration) and user settings (individual preferences):

- **Admin Settings**: Affect all users and require administrative privileges
- **User Settings**: Personal preferences that only affect the current user's experience
- **Self-Service Options**: Allow users to modify their own account details without admin intervention
